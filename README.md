# Project Name
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. 
The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them at a higher price. The 
company wants to know 

* Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
* How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different types of cars across the American market. 





## General Information
  Read and Understanding the data 
  treatment of the null values
  Removed the uneanted column which has 85% value same
  Created new variable and treated the outliers
  EDA was performed
  Created the Dummies variable 
  Performed Train and test data
  performed scaling of numerical data
  Performed the RFE
  Model BUilding and Evaluation using Ridge and Lasso meodel
  Caluclated the R2 valueto find the better model



<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
alpha for Ridge and Lasso is 0.2 and 50 respectively

R2 in ridge model
0.8810288579575475 - Training 
0.843660833927554  - Test

R2 in Lasso model
0.8780086523403146  - Training 
0.8524629680496181  - Test data

Lssso model is having a better R2 value than the ridge model
